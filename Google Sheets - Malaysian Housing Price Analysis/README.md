# Malaysian Condominium Prices Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the price trends of condominiums in Malaysia using **Google Spreadsheets**. The dataset includes key metrics such as property location, square footage, price per square foot, and other relevant features to provide insights into the real estate market. This analysis can be used by potential investors, real estate agents, or home buyers to understand market dynamics and pricing trends.

## Objective
- To explore and identify pricing patterns for condominiums across different locations in Malaysia.
- To analyze the relationship between condominium features (such as size and location) and their prices.
- To offer insights for making informed decisions in the Malaysian real estate market.

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: Summary statistics and key metrics are calculated to provide an overview of the dataset.
- **Price Trends**: Analysis of price per square foot across different regions and property sizes.
- **Correlation & Linear Regression Analysis**: Examining the relationship between property size and price to identify key pricing determinants.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Exploration
   - **Overview of Dataset**: The dataset includes variables such as property location, size (in square feet), and price.
   - **Summary Statistics**: Basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation are calculated for key metrics such as property size and price per square foot.

### 2. Price Trends Analysis
   - **Price per Square Foot**: Visualizing price per square foot to understand variations across different regions.
   - **Regional Analysis**: Comparing the average price per square foot in various regions to identify high-value areas.

### 3. Correlation Analysis
   - **Size vs. Price**: A scatter plot and correlation coefficient are used to assess the relationship between property size and price.
   - **Key Findings**: Significant trends between property location and pricing were identified.
### 4. Linear Regression Analysis
   - **Price Prediction Model**: for predicting future condominium prices based on historical data
   - **Hypothesis Testing**: for confirming the linear regression model into more reliable one

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Google Spreadsheets**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
  - **Functions Used**: SUM, AVERAGE, CORREL, and others to compute statistics.
  - **Charts & Graphs**: Bar charts and scatter plots to visualize pricing trends and relationships.
- **XLMiner**: For Correlation Analysis and Linear Regression modelling
  
## Key Findings
- Condominiums in urban areas (e.g., Kuala Lumpur) tend to have a higher price per square foot compared to those in suburban or rural regions.
- There is a **moderate correlation** between the size of the condominium and its price, indicating that larger properties generally have a higher price, but other factors also play a significant role.
- Price per square foot varies significantly between different regions, with the highest prices observed in city centers.

## Future Work
- **Additional Factors**: Expand the analysis to include more factors like property age, amenities, and proximity to public transportation.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Incorporate time-based data to analyze how prices have changed over time.
- **Prediction Models**: Use machine learning techniques to predict future condominium prices based on historical data.
