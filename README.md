## About Me
Hi, I'm Febri Ridho Baharianto! I have a strong analytical background in Data Analytics, and I’m currently working as a freelance Data Analyst for RevoU. My passion lies in using data to uncover meaningful insights, and I’m eager to apply my technical and analytical skills as I continue to grow as a Data Specialist.

Since 2022, I’ve mentored and led students in the Full Stack Data Analytics program at RevoU. This experience has honed my ability to guide teams in working with complex datasets, identifying patterns, and interpreting trends. I am also proficient in a variety of tools and technologies commonly used in Data Analytics, including Python, Google BigQuery, Tableau, PowerBI, Alteryx, Talend, and RStudio.

Feel free to check out my [resume](https://github.com/pacheputih/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Resume%202024.pdf), and explore this repository, where I showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.
