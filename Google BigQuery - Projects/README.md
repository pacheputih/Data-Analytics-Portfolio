# Google BigQuery SQL Query Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio contains a compilation of SQL queries executed on public datasets using **Google BigQuery**. Each `.sql` file in this repository demonstrates my ability to query large datasets, extract insights, and analyze trends across different domains, such as liquor sales, sports, and e-commerce.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Proficiency**: Writing efficient and optimized SQL queries to extract relevant insights.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing and interpreting large datasets to identify trends and patterns.
- **BigQuery Expertise**: Using Google BigQuery for querying and managing big datasets.

## Datasets Used
The following public datasets were used in the SQL queries:

- **Iowa Liquor Sales** (`iowa_liquor_sales.sql`): Analyzing liquor sales trends in Iowa, including sales volume, and retail locations.
- **NCAA Basketball** (`ncaa_basketball.sql`): Querying NCAA basketball data to evaluate player statistics and game outcomes.
- **The Looker E-commerce** (`thelook_ecommerce.sql`): Exploring a fictional e-commerce dataset to perform sales analysis, and product performance evaluations.

## Files

1. **iowa_liquor_sales.sql**: 
   - This query analyzes trends in liquor sales across different counties in Iowa.
   - Key Insights:
     - Total sales by city
     - Average weekly sales per store
     - Top 10 store sales within a certain time period
     - Growth rate of sales by city
     - Data Manipulation to create "City-Zipcode" format
     - Comparison of sales YoY per stores

2. **ncaa_basketball.sql**:
   - This query examines team and player performance across NCAA basketball seasons.
   - Key Insights:
     - Top scorer within certain match and season

3. **thelook_ecommerce.sql**:
   - This query investigates customer behavior and sales performance in a fictional e-commerce store.
   - Key Insights:
     - Monthly users behavior based on orders
     - Monthly performance based on average order value and number of customer
     - Finding user's first and last name based on age
     - Top 5 most profitable products
     - Month-to-date of Total Revenue

## How to Run
To run these queries, follow these steps:

1. **Set up Google BigQuery**: 
   - If you donâ€™t have access to BigQuery, sign up for Google Cloud Platform [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/).
   
2. **Access the public datasets**: 
   - Open the BigQuery console, and access the respective public datasets for `Iowa Liquor Sales`, `NCAA Basketball`, and `The Looker E-commerce`.
   
3. **Run the queries**:
   - Copy the contents of any `.sql` file (e.g., `iowa_liquor_sales.sql`) and paste it into the BigQuery query editor.
   - Execute the query and explore the results.

## Future Enhancements
- **New Queries**: Continuously adding new queries using different datasets to broaden the portfolio.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrating data visualization tools (e.g., Google Data Studio, Tableau) to present insights visually.
